## Features
- Add various noise types to images such as uniform, guassian & salt-pepper noise.
- Filtration of noisy images using low pass filters such as: average, Gaussian, median filters.
- Edge detection using variety of masks such as: Sobel, Prewitt, Roberts and canny edge detectors.
- Change RGB images to grayscale
- View histograms of images and show equalization & normalization of image.
- Add frequency domain filters such as low-pass, high-pass & Gaussian filters.
- Mix images in frequency domain to get Hybrid images.
- Apply Hough transform for detecting parametric shapes like circles, ellipses and lines
- Apply Active Contour Model for semi-supervised shape delineation.
- Extract the unique features in all images using Harris
operator
- Generate feature descriptors using scale invariant features
(SIFT).
- Match the image set features using sum of squared differences (SSD) and normalized cross correlations (NCC).
- Apply thresholding using optimal thresholding, Otsu, spectral thresholding (more than 2 modes), local & global thresholding.
- Do unspervised segmentation using k-means, region growing, agglomerative and mean shift methods.
- Detect faces (color or grayscale)
- Recognize faces based on PCA/Eigen analysis

## Dependenices
    - Qt Version 6.4.2
    - Qt Charts
    - OpenCV 4.7.0

## How to run the project
- Download and Install Qt from the online installer using minGW 64 architecture.
```
www.qt.io
```
make sure that QtCharts is enabled

- Download and build openCV 4.7.0 from their website
```
www.opencv.org/releases/
```
- if you don't know how to build openCV on your PC please refer to the installCV.md

- Go to the project.pro file and make sure that openCV libraries are refered to in your pc like that.
```
